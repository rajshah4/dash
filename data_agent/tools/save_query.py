Save Validated Query Tool
=========================

Enhanced tool for saving validated SQL queries to the knowledge base.
Enables the self-learning loop where successful queries become retrievable patterns.

Features:
- Validates query safety (SELECT/WITH only)
- Stores rich metadata for retrieval
- Tracks data quality notes and business context

    """Save a validated SQL query and its explanation to the knowledge base.

    Call this tool ONLY after:
    1. The query has been executed successfully
    2. The user has confirmed the results are correct
    3. The user has agreed to save the query

    This enables the self-learning loop: future similar questions will retrieve
    this validated query pattern, improving accuracy over time.

    Args:
        name: Short descriptive name for the query (e.g., "championship_wins_by_driver").
        question: The original natural language question from the user.
        query: The exact SQL query that was executed and validated.
        summary: Brief explanation of what the query does and what it returns.
        tables_used: List of tables used in the query for easier retrieval.
        data_quality_notes: Data quality issues encountered and how they were handled
            (e.g., "position is TEXT in drivers_championship - used string comparison").
        business_context: Business logic or domain knowledge applied
            (e.g., "Constructors Championship started in 1958").

    Returns:
        str: Status message indicating success or failure.

    Example:

            name="most_race_wins_2019",
            question="Who won the most races in 2019?",
