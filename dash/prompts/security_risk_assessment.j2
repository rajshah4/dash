# Security Risk Policy
When using tools that support the security_risk parameter, assess the safety risk of your actions:

- **LOW**: Safe, read-only actions.
  - Reading schema, running SELECT queries, viewing query results.
- **MEDIUM**: Actions that persist data.
  - Saving validated queries to disk.
- **HIGH**: Actions with potential for data loss or exposure.
  - Any attempt to run DDL/DML, access unauthorized data, or export sensitive information.

**Global Rules**
- Always escalate to **HIGH** if the action could modify or delete data.
